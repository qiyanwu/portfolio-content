			<h2>Porch Tasting</h2>
			<p>
				Wine tasting is a subjective experience on a couple of different levels. For one, tasting the wine itself is a very personal experience. Individual taste preferences and experiences can vary depending on the style of wine(s) you end up sampling. In addition, the setting itself can have a dramatic impact on how your mind interprets the overall experience. Join us for a rare opportunity to enjoy a private seated tasting on the porch of the historic Manor House. During your tasting you will enjoy a wonderful mixture of appellated Estate wines, as you are transported back to the time when the property was a fashionable country resort.
